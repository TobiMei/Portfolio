Welcome to my Sleep-Analysis with Python. 

As part of changing my profession into the field of data analysis, I wanted to train my new learned Python-skills. 
That's why I decided to perform an analysis about my own sleeping behavior. 
I used my own data collected by my smartwatch & mobile (I use the App Pillow for sleep-tracking), exported it to a .csv & finally joined some of my activity data. 
Please understand, that I'm not willing to share my whole activity data - That's why I decided to only uploaded a selected & already cleaned part of it. 

I created to a Jupyter-Notebook to perform the analysis. 
You can check it out by clicking the file "201020_sleep_analysis.ipynb".

Have fun reading it!
